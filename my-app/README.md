# Getting Started with Create React App

## React first lab

#### Overview
You have seen how amazing React is and saw what I did in the code along. Now try to replicate it.

### Instructions
Add a <h1> to the <App.js> component and give it a title
Add a paragraph that says "My name is {your name} and this is my first React component". Style your name differently using <span>
Add an image from the internet and put it inside an <img> tag
Create a new functional component called <Article> and inside it add the following:
Create a <header> that includes a <h2> element with an article element. You can put any title here.
Create a <p> tag to hold the description
Include the <Article> component in the <page> component
